Background Process of async task is called here withouht affecting the Main thread in Java script

Andorid Code for multi threading, I have called the backgorund thread in native code using Async Task, Once can similarly call any backgorund task which comsumes High data on background thread.
And It does not affect the working of main thread in Java script.
Since Java script works only in single thread it becomes mandatory to use backgorund thread in native code.
